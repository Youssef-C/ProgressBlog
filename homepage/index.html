        <h3 class="entryTitle" id="entryTitle00">First week!</h3>
       <p class="entry"> The very first week of my studies I began learning the absolute basics about JavaScript and dug deeper into CSS and HTML. 
           I watched tutorials on YouTube about JS and followed along to the best of my abilities, made sure to take notes. 
           And made a website in class with a group of classmates. We made a site about ourselves and 
           our "Stinky Fishes", which was an assignment we got in order to get to know eachother better.</p>

        <h3 class="entryTitle" id="entryTitle01">Second Week!</h3>
       <p class="entry"> During my second week I slowed down on my JS learning and instead focused on GIT and collaborative coding. Learning how to set up an environment for 
           coding in a group and making a github repo. It was at first very difficult and weird, but I feel I quickly got the hang of it. Me and my group made a website 
           about older video games, where we used git and github to collaborate. It went well and we are going to get feedback from our other classmates next week.
